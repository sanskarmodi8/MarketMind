## 🌟 Overview

MarketMind is an advanced autonomous trading system that leverages **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to make intelligent Bitcoin trading decisions. Built with the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm, it learns optimal trading strategies through continuous market interaction while managing risk and transaction costs.

### 🎯 What Makes MarketMind Special?

- **🤖 Intelligent Decision Making**: Uses PPO algorithm to learn complex trading patterns
- **📊 Technical Analysis**: Incorporates multiple technical indicators and market features
- **🔄 Long-Only Strategy**: Focuses on buy, hold, and sell decisions (no short selling)
- **📈 Real-time Predictions**: Live market data integration with Yahoo Finance
- **🌐 Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful Streamlit web interface for monitoring and predictions
- **🔬 Experiment Tracking**: Comprehensive MLflow integration for model versioning and comparison
- **📈 Proven Outperformance**: RL agent achieved **~204% total return** vs **124% buy-and-hold** in backtests
- **🔄 Weekly Automatic Retraining**: Keep your model up-to-date with the latest market data using a single command (`python main.py`)
